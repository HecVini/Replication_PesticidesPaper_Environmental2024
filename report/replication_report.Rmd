# Introduction 

- Increasing demand for agricultural  productions, combined with land restrictions and changing weather has contribuited to the extensive use of agrochemicals
            
- Issue:This use of chemicals has severe negative effects on the populations living close to the farms or working on them
            
* But, still there are few studies analyzing the effects of enviromental pollution on health outcomes
            
+ very few that leverage quasi-experimental variation to estimate the health effects of the use of pesticides in agriculture
            
 - Goal of this paper: examine the effects of pesticides used in banana plantations in Ecuador on newborn's health outcomes


# Empirical Strategy

- DiD approach that exploits the seasonal changes in the fumigation of banana plantations as an identification strategy
- 4 newborn's health outcomes: weight at birth, gestational length, low birth weight, and preterm
- Use of mother's address durirng pregancy and precise information on the perimeter of the plantations to compute measures of exposure to air pollution
- Compute the mother's distance from the plantation and the area of fumigated plantations near their place of residence


$$
 Y_{ijmy} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\text{Banana Exposure}_{ijmy} + \beta_{2}\text{Intensive Fumigations}_{ijmy} + \\ \theta \text{Banana Exposure}_{ijmy} \times \text{Intensive Fumigations}_{ijmy} + \\  \delta X_{i} + \mu_{j} + \psi_{m} + \pi_{y} + \epsilon_{ijmy} 
$$

$$
 Y_{ijmy} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\text{Banana Exposure}_{ijmy} + \sum_{z=1}^{3} \beta_{z} Z^{th}\text{Intensive Fumigations}_{ijmy} + \\  \sum_{z=1}^{3} \theta_{z} Z^{th}\text{Banana Exposure}_{ijmy} \times   Z^{th}\text{Intensive Fumigations}_{ijmy} + \\  \delta X_{i} + \mu_{j} + \psi_{m} + \pi_{y} + \epsilon_{ijmy}
$$


in which:

- $Y_{ijmy}$: birth outcomes of newborn $i$, in a grid cell $j$, month $m$ and year 
- $\text{Banana Exposure}_{ijmy}$: is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 for newborns from mothers geographically exposed to pesticides
 - $\text{Intensive Fumigations}_{ijmy}$: is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 for newbornds that were affected by intensive fumigations for at least theree months during gestation
- $Z^{th}\text{Intensive Fumigations}_{ijmy}$: is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 for the newbornds that were affected by intensive fumigations during the three months of the $Z^{th}$ gestation trimester.
 - $X$: vector of controls

```

For **Newborn's health**, the authors collected data from:
        
- dataset from the National Register of Live Births for the period 2015-17  (information on the mother's residential addresses during pregancy)
 - data set includes information on several observable characteristics of children and mothers
On the other hand, the dataset containing information about  **Ecuador's banana plantations:** came from:
 - 2013 agricultural census
 - 2016-18 register of aerial fumigations (geocoded data on the application of the pesticide)
